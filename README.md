# web-scrapping
A comprehensive Python web scraper that collects movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes using Selenium WebDriver. I built this tool to gather large datasets of critic reviews for sentiment analysis and movie review research projects. Currently targeting 1100+ reviews across multiple high-profile movies.
